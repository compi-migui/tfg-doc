<!--  Descripció i anàlisis dels resultats obtinguts amb la metodologia proposada -->
Describe results and analyze them. Make sure to include pretty graphs whenever possible. Everybody loves pretty pictures.

## Reproduction

### Results of kNN
<!--  TODO: make figure/table references actual links to the referencee -->

The performance indicators for the k-NN classifier using principal components that explain 90% of variance are displayed in figure \ref{fig:reproduce-indicators-plot-knn-var0.9}. We can see that the best results are obtained with k=100. This differs from the values reached because the shape of our data set is slightly different: whereas (TODO: explain this comparing both datasets. number and length of trials)

### Results of SVM

## Proposed improvements

### Results of additional classifier(s)
bad

### Results of scaling and dimensionality reduction on the training set only
*shrug*
