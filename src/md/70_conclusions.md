# Conclusions
<!--  Segons els resultats obtinguts, conclusions, limitacions i extensions futures -->

Summarize the results we saw a little bit. Were we able to reproduce the original methodology satisfactorily? Can we be said to be safe from the replication crisis, at least for today?

What about the stuff we added on top? Did it give us any new insight? Was it about the same as what was already there? Or did we just come up with a new way to _not_ do Structural Health Monitoring for offshore wind turbines?

## Limitations
What are the limitations of our results? How far away is this methodology from something that could reasonably be applied on an actual, real-world wind turbine? (probably very)

## Future steps
What would one try or improve next? How to get this closer to real implementation in the field? And so we hand off the baton to whoever wants to do those things.
