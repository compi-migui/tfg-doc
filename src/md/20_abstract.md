## Abstract
Due to their remote location, inspection and maintenance activities on offshore wind turbines are very costly both in terms of risk to workers' health and safety and in economic cost. Improved processing of remotely-sensed data can help minimize the number of interventions needed, and thus also the human and economic costs involved.
In this project we take an existing proof of concept for an approach to structural health monitoring via machine learning algorithms, attempt to reproduce its results using a different experimental dataset and evaluate some potential improvements.
