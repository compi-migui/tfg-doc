# Acknowledgments
What a long, strange trip it has been. I started attending EUETIB for my Bachelor's Degree ten years ago; I never would have guessed it would take me so long to finish it that they had time to rename the place and move it half a city over. Life got in the way of the degree, or perhaps the degree got in the way of life.

During that time I have been extremely lucky to be surrounded by the most amazing people, to the point that giving them the thanks that they deserve would take up many more pages than the document in front of you. It would also probably take me longer than my degree has. I will settle for listing a small handful of people and mentioning only a tiny fraction of what they mean to me.

To Jersson Xavier Leon Medina, Núria Parés and Francesc Pozo, thank you for readily providing the experimental data used in this study.

To my thesis supervisor Francesc Pozo (a second time!), thank you for taking a chance on a dropout you had not heard from in years, and for being flexible enough that I was able to do this this while working full time. You were there my first day at University and it is oh so fitting that you are the one to help me finally wrap the whole thing up.

To my family, thank you for doing your best. To my grandfather Diego, who passed away while I was working on this, I am sorry you never got to see a grandchild graduate from University.

To Paula, Míriam, Blanca and Ivan, who were also there my first day at University, thank you for still being at my side today. To África, thank you for patiently guiding the old me towards the new me for longer than I have known myself. To Valeria, thank you for being there for me for as long as you were able. To Eva, Sandra and Aixa, thank you for perceiving and understanding me. To Sara, thank you for never backing down against injustice. To Alice, thank your for always calling a spade a spade. Thank you all for supporting me and believing in me even when I did not, for filling my life to the brim with joy and for inspiring me with your perseverance.

To David McGillicuddy, Russell and Lenard, thank you for selflessly reaching out to strangers, for explaining it is not my fault and for showing me that many great problems have great workarounds.

To all those who have touched my life and whose life I have touched; to those I love whether I have already named them or not; to those best not named in the public record, because you never know; to those so enchanting and magical that it would be a disservice to name them in a document so lacking in whimsy; you are my everything and I am more thankful than I know how to express in English or in any other language, but that will not stop me from trying every day.

To you, the reader, thank you for taking the time to hear about all these people who mean the world to me.
