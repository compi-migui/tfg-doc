	abstract = {Structural health monitoring for offshore wind turbines is imperative. Offshore wind energy is progressively attained at greater water depths, beyond 30 m, where jacket foundations are presently the best solution to cope with the harsh environment (extreme sites with poor soil conditions). Structural integrity is of key importance in these underwater structures. In this work, a methodology for the diagnosis of structural damage in jacket-type foundations is stated. The method is based on the criterion that any damage or structural change produces variations in the vibrational response of the structure. Most studies in this area are, primarily, focused on the case of measurable input excitation and vibration response signals. Nevertheless, in this paper it is assumed that the only available excitation, the wind, is not measurable. Therefore, using vibration-response-only accelerometer information, a data-driven approach is developed following the next steps: (i) the wind is simulated as a Gaussian white noise and the accelerometer data are collected; (ii) the data are pre-processed using group-reshape and column-scaling; (iii) principal component analysis is used for both linear dimensionality reduction and feature extraction; finally, (iv) two different machine-learning algorithms, k nearest neighbor (k-{NN}) and quadratic-kernel support vector machine ({SVM}), are tested as classifiers. The overall accuracy is estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed approach is experimentally validated in a laboratory small-scale structure. The results manifest the reliability of the stated fault diagnosis method being the best performance given by the {SVM} classifier.},

Performance indicators are very useful when the aim is to evaluate and compare different classification models or machine learning techniques. Many metrics come in handy to test the ability of a multi-class classifier. Those metrics turn out to be useful at different stage of the development process, e.g. comparing the performance of two different models or analysing the behaviour of the same model by tuning different parameters. In this white paper we review a list of the most promising multi-class metrics, we highlight their advantages and disadvantages and show their possible usages during the development of a classification model.},

	abstract = {Several performance metrics are currently available to evaluate the performance of Machine Learning ({ML}) models in classification problems. {ML} models are usually assessed using a single measure because it facilitates the comparison between several models. However, there is no silver bullet since each performance metric emphasizes a different aspect of the classification. Thus, the choice depends on the particular requirements and characteristics of the problem. An additional problem arises in multi-class classification problems, since most of the well-known metrics are only directly applicable to binary classification problems. In this paper, we propose the General Performance Score ({GPS}), a methodological approach to build performance metrics for binary and multi-class classification problems. The basic idea behind {GPS} is to combine a set of individual metrics, penalising low values in any of them. Thus, users can combine several performance metrics that are relevant in the particular problem based on their preferences obtaining a conservative combination. Different {GPS}-based performance metrics are compared with alternatives in classification problems using real and simulated datasets. The metrics built using the proposed method improve the stability and explainability of the usual performance metrics. Finally, the {GPS} brings benefits in both new research lines and practical usage, where performance metrics tailored for each particular problem are considered.},

The analysis of such metrics and its significance must be interpreted correctly for evaluating different learning algorithms. Most of these measures are scalar metrics and some of them are graphical methods. This paper introduces a detailed overview of the classification assessment measures with the aim of providing the basics of these measures and to show how it works to serve as a comprehensive source for researchers who are interested in this field. This overview starts by highlighting the definition of the confusion matrix in binary and multi-class classification problems. Many classification measures are also explained in details, and the influence of balanced and imbalanced data on each metric is presented. An illustrative example is introduced to show (1) how to calculate these measures in binary and multi-class classification problems, and (2) the robustness of some measures against balanced and imbalanced data. Moreover, some graphical measures such as Receiver operating characteristics ({ROC}), Precision-Recall, and Detection error trade-off ({DET}) curves are presented with details. Additionally, in a step-by-step approach, different numerical examples are demonstrated to explain the preprocessing steps of plotting {ROC}, {PR}, and {DET} curves.},

However, Matthews correlation coefficient applies only to cases where the assignments belong to two categories, and cases with more than two categories are often artificially forced into two categories by considering what belongs and what does not belong to one of the categories, leading to the loss of information. Here, an extended correlation coefficient that applies to K-categories is proposed, and this measure is shown to be highly applicable for evaluating prediction of {RNA} secondary structure in cases where some predicted pairs go into the category "unknown" due to lack of reliability in predicted pairs or unpaired residues. Hence, predicting base pairs of {RNA} secondary structure can be a three-category problem. The measure is further shown to be well in agreement with existing performance measures used for ranking protein secondary structure predictions.

It focuses on the vibration levels and modal parameters of the fundamental modes of the support structure. These parameters are crucial to minimize the operation and maintenance costs and to extend the lifetime of offshore wind turbine structure and mechanical systems. In order to perform a proper continuous monitoring during operation, a fast and reliable solution, applicable on an industrial scale, has been developed. It will be shown that the use of appropriate vibration measurement equipment together with state-of-the art operational modal analysis techniques can provide accurate estimates of natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes of offshore wind turbines. The identification methods have been automated and their reliability has been improved, so that the system can track small changes in the dynamic behavior of offshore wind turbines.

	abstract = {Machine-learning ({ML}) methods have gained prominence in the quantitative sciences. However, there are many known methodological pitfalls, including data leakage, in {ML}-based science. We systematically investigate reproducibility issues in {ML}-based science. Through a survey of literature in fields that have adopted {ML} methods, we find 17 fields where leakage has been found, collectively affecting 294 papers and, in some cases, leading to wildly overoptimistic conclusions. Based on our survey, we introduce a detailed taxonomy of eight types of leakage, ranging from textbook errors to open research problems. We propose that researchers test for each type of leakage by filling out model info sheets, which we introduce. Finally, we conduct a reproducibility study of civil war prediction, where complex {ML} models are believed to vastly outperform traditional statistical models such as logistic regression ({LR}). When the errors are corrected, complex {ML} models do not perform substantively better than decades-old {LR} models.},

The expectation is that most statistically significant findings can be replicated in new data and in new laboratories, but in practice many findings have replicated less often than expected, leading to claims of a replication crisis. We review recent methodological literature on questionable research practices, meta-analysis, and power analysis to explain the apparently high rates of failure to replicate. Psychologists can improve research practices to advance knowledge in ways that improve replicability. We recommend that researchers adopt open science conventions of preregi-stration and full disclosure and that replication efforts be based on multiple studies rather than on a single replication attempt. We call for more sophisticated power analyses, careful consideration of the various influences on effect sizes, and more complete disclosure of nonsignificant as well as statistically significant findings.},

Nevertheless, the replication crisis highlights the operation of psychological science at its best, as it reflects our growing humility. At the same time, institutional variables, especially the growing emphasis on external funding as an expectation or de facto requirement for faculty tenure and promotion, pose largely unappreciated hazards for psychological science, including (a) incentives for engaging in questionable research practices, (b) a single-minded focus on programmatic research, (c) intellectual hyperspecialization, (d) disincentives for conducting direct replications, (e) stifling of creativity and intellectual risk taking, (f) researchers promising more than they can deliver, and (g) diminished time for thinking deeply. Preregistration should assist with (a), but will do little about (b) through (g).

	abstract = {One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery. Concerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research. Reproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.},

	abstract = {Reproducible research---by its many names---has come to be regarded as a key concern across disciplines and stakeholder groups. Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},

It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, {NumPy} was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. {NumPy} is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own {NumPy}-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, {NumPy} increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface ({API}), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},
