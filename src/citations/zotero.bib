	abstract = {Structural health monitoring for offshore wind turbines is imperative. Offshore wind energy is progressively attained at greater water depths, beyond 30 m, where jacket foundations are presently the best solution to cope with the harsh environment (extreme sites with poor soil conditions). Structural integrity is of key importance in these underwater structures. In this work, a methodology for the diagnosis of structural damage in jacket-type foundations is stated. The method is based on the criterion that any damage or structural change produces variations in the vibrational response of the structure. Most studies in this area are, primarily, focused on the case of measurable input excitation and vibration response signals. Nevertheless, in this paper it is assumed that the only available excitation, the wind, is not measurable. Therefore, using vibration-response-only accelerometer information, a data-driven approach is developed following the next steps: (i) the wind is simulated as a Gaussian white noise and the accelerometer data are collected; (ii) the data are pre-processed using group-reshape and column-scaling; (iii) principal component analysis is used for both linear dimensionality reduction and feature extraction; finally, (iv) two different machine-learning algorithms, k nearest neighbor (k-{NN}) and quadratic-kernel support vector machine ({SVM}), are tested as classifiers. The overall accuracy is estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed approach is experimentally validated in a laboratory small-scale structure. The results manifest the reliability of the stated fault diagnosis method being the best performance given by the {SVM} classifier.},

Performance indicators are very useful when the aim is to evaluate and compare different classification models or machine learning techniques. Many metrics come in handy to test the ability of a multi-class classifier. Those metrics turn out to be useful at different stage of the development process, e.g. comparing the performance of two different models or analysing the behaviour of the same model by tuning different parameters. In this white paper we review a list of the most promising multi-class metrics, we highlight their advantages and disadvantages and show their possible usages during the development of a classification model.},

	abstract = {Several performance metrics are currently available to evaluate the performance of Machine Learning ({ML}) models in classification problems. {ML} models are usually assessed using a single measure because it facilitates the comparison between several models. However, there is no silver bullet since each performance metric emphasizes a different aspect of the classification. Thus, the choice depends on the particular requirements and characteristics of the problem. An additional problem arises in multi-class classification problems, since most of the well-known metrics are only directly applicable to binary classification problems. In this paper, we propose the General Performance Score ({GPS}), a methodological approach to build performance metrics for binary and multi-class classification problems. The basic idea behind {GPS} is to combine a set of individual metrics, penalising low values in any of them. Thus, users can combine several performance metrics that are relevant in the particular problem based on their preferences obtaining a conservative combination. Different {GPS}-based performance metrics are compared with alternatives in classification problems using real and simulated datasets. The metrics built using the proposed method improve the stability and explainability of the usual performance metrics. Finally, the {GPS} brings benefits in both new research lines and practical usage, where performance metrics tailored for each particular problem are considered.},

The analysis of such metrics and its significance must be interpreted correctly for evaluating different learning algorithms. Most of these measures are scalar metrics and some of them are graphical methods. This paper introduces a detailed overview of the classification assessment measures with the aim of providing the basics of these measures and to show how it works to serve as a comprehensive source for researchers who are interested in this field. This overview starts by highlighting the definition of the confusion matrix in binary and multi-class classification problems. Many classification measures are also explained in details, and the influence of balanced and imbalanced data on each metric is presented. An illustrative example is introduced to show (1) how to calculate these measures in binary and multi-class classification problems, and (2) the robustness of some measures against balanced and imbalanced data. Moreover, some graphical measures such as Receiver operating characteristics ({ROC}), Precision-Recall, and Detection error trade-off ({DET}) curves are presented with details. Additionally, in a step-by-step approach, different numerical examples are demonstrated to explain the preprocessing steps of plotting {ROC}, {PR}, and {DET} curves.},

However, Matthews correlation coefficient applies only to cases where the assignments belong to two categories, and cases with more than two categories are often artificially forced into two categories by considering what belongs and what does not belong to one of the categories, leading to the loss of information. Here, an extended correlation coefficient that applies to K-categories is proposed, and this measure is shown to be highly applicable for evaluating prediction of {RNA} secondary structure in cases where some predicted pairs go into the category "unknown" due to lack of reliability in predicted pairs or unpaired residues. Hence, predicting base pairs of {RNA} secondary structure can be a three-category problem. The measure is further shown to be well in agreement with existing performance measures used for ranking protein secondary structure predictions.

It focuses on the vibration levels and modal parameters of the fundamental modes of the support structure. These parameters are crucial to minimize the operation and maintenance costs and to extend the lifetime of offshore wind turbine structure and mechanical systems. In order to perform a proper continuous monitoring during operation, a fast and reliable solution, applicable on an industrial scale, has been developed. It will be shown that the use of appropriate vibration measurement equipment together with state-of-the art operational modal analysis techniques can provide accurate estimates of natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes of offshore wind turbines. The identification methods have been automated and their reliability has been improved, so that the system can track small changes in the dynamic behavior of offshore wind turbines. The advanced modal analysis tools used in this application include the poly-reference least squares complex frequency-domain estimator, commercially known as {PolyMAX}, and the covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification method. The implemented processing strategy will be demonstrated on data continuously collected during 2 weeks, while the wind turbine was idling or parked.},
